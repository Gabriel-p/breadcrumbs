The standard deviation of the bootstrap sample is a standard error


In a recent question I made, I got a [comment](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/408516/bootstrap-and-numerical-optimization-of-statistic/408827?noredirect=1#comment763942_408827)
by AdamO stating that:

> the standard deviation of that bootstrap sample is in fact a standard error

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this statement.

> standard error, which is basically the standard deviation of the statistic

> It is easy to see that as B -> inf, $\hat{\sigma}_B$ (the sample standard
deviation) will approach $\hat{\sigma}=\sigma(\hat{F})$, the bootstrap estimate
of standard error.
